## 16S rRNA gene database

* [RDP](https://rdp.cme.msu.edu/): RDP provides quality-controlled, aligned and annotated Bacterial and Archaeal 16S rRNA sequences
* [SILVA](https://www.arb-silva.de/): SILVA provides comprehensive, quality checked and regularly updated datasets of aligned small (16S/18S, SSU) and large subunit (23S/28S, LSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences
* [GreenGene](http://www.greengene.com/): Greengenes is a quality controlled, comprehensive 16S reference database and taxonomy based on a de novo phylogeny that provides standard operational taxonomic unit sets
* [rrnDB](https://rrndb.umms.med.umich.edu/): A searchable database documenting variation in ribosomal RNA operons (rrn) in Bacteria and Archaea
* [EzTaxon-e](https://www.ezbiocloud.net/): It contains comprehensive 16S rRNA gene sequences of taxa with valid names as well as sequences of uncultured taxa

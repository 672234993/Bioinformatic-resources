## General
* [speedseq](https://github.com/hall-lab/speedseq): A flexible framework for rapid genome analysis and interpretation

* [pycoQC](https://github.com/a-slide/pycoQC): pycoQC computes metrics and generates Interactive QC plots from the sequencing summary report generated by Oxford Nanopore technologies basecaller (Albacore/Guppy)

* [somaticseq](https://github.com/bioinform/somaticseq): An ensemble approach to accurately detect somatic mutations using SomaticSeq
* [qcat](https://github.com/nanoporetech/qcat): qcat is Python command-line tool for demultiplexing Oxford Nanopore reads from FASTQ files


## Trio

* [denovogear](https://github.com/denovogear/denovogear): A program to detect denovo-variants using next-generation sequencing data. 
* [VBT-TrioAnalysis](https://github.com/sbg/VBT-TrioAnalysis)



## Assembly

* [NovoGraph](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/NovoGraph): Genome Graph of Long-read De Novo Assemblies

## Genotyping

* [NGSEPcore](https://github.com/NGSEP/NGSEPcore): an integrated framework for analysis of high throughput sequencing (HTS) reads. The main functionality of NGSEP is the variants detector, which allows to make integrated discovery and genotyping of Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs), insertions, deletions, and genomic regions with copy number variation (CNVs)



## Plotter

* [ClustersPloter](https://github.com/orangeSi/ClustersPloter): visualize genome features cluster
* [Plot chromosome ideograms along with other genomic data](https://gist.github.com/daler/c98fc410282d7570efc3)


## 10X

* [SVenX](https://github.com/vborjesson/SVenX): Pipeline for SV detection using 10X genomics data

* [Zika-RNAseq-Pipeline](https://github.com/MaayanLab/Zika-RNAseq-Pipeline): An open RNA-Seq data analysis pipeline tutorial with an example of reprocessing data from a recent Zika virus study



## Methylation

* [methylpy](https://github.com/yupenghe/methylpy): WGBS/NOMe-seq Data Processing & Differential 
Methylation Analysis
* [ViewBS](https://github.com/xie186/ViewBS): a powerful toolkit for visualization of high-throughput bisulfite sequencing data
